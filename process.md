# Milestone 1

Our project is a digital magazine using different elements we create on our own and borrow from the new york times. The magazine will include at least 3 spreads (2 “pages”) with different magazine components such as cartoons, poetry, stories, horoscopes, word games etc. All of the magazine content will be interactive, enhancing the magazine experience in a web format. 

We want to create this magazine because it will show case our graphic design/layout design skills for our portfolios, and making the project seamlessly interactive will also be a good coding challenge. The inspiration for our magazine are these cool magazine spreads we found on pintrest. The combination of photography, typography, and color is very inspiring.

The intended audience for our magazine is creative minds, specifically people interested in  graphic and layout design.

My personal contribution will be a spread (2 pages) in the magazine. I will also collaborate on the overall style of the magazine as well as making my portion and the rest of it interactive.
