# Milestone 1

Group Members:
Nancy Yoder
Jordan Evans
Raiyah Shah

Our project is a digital magazine using different elements we create on our own and borrow from the new york times. The magazine will include at least 3 spreads (2 “pages”) with different magazine components such as cartoons, poetry, stories, horoscopes, word games etc. All of the magazine content will be interactive, enhancing the magazine experience in a web format. 

We want to create this magazine because it will show case our graphic design/layout design skills for our portfolios, and making the project seamlessly interactive will also be a good coding challenge. The inspiration for our magazine are these cool magazine spreads we found on pintrest. The combination of photography, typography, and color is very inspiring.

The intended audience for our magazine is creative minds, specifically people interested in  graphic and layout design.

Nancy - My personal contribution will be a spread (2 pages) in the magazine. I will also collaborate on the overall style of the magazine as well as making my portion and the rest of it interactive. 

Jordan - My personal contribution will also be a 2 page spread in the magazine (probably about beauty, but definitely focusing on a specific topic like that). It will showcase interactive features throughout the article using react.I would also (if time allots) add in a small game.

Raiyah - My personal contribution will be a two page spread as well in the magazine with an article about horoscopes and a simple, interactive game for users. We will all contribute to the overall aesthetic of the magazine and the varying design components.

Goals: 
- Prototyping/proof of concept
    - Interactivity with type using react
    - Interactivity with image using react
    - Recreation of cover
    - Design kit
    - Flip the pages mechanism
- MVP
    - Interactive cover
    - Interactive cartoon
    - Interactive typography spread
    - Interactive story
    - Works well
- Stretch goals
    - Interactive game/experience (horoscope?)
    - More interactivity
    - Flip animation or scroll/appear animation

# Milestone 2

To get this project started I made a framework for the app by making "pages" objects which house all of the content for each unique page. I was then able to recreate the mockup I made for milestone 1 putting the image on page 1 and the text on page 2. I stuggled to figure out how to use adobe fonts on this site, but after watching tutorials I was able to do this quite easily. I haven't yet tested the interactivity I was planning on, but I will start working on that today. I am realizing that react is not as straightforward as I orginally thought and therefore I think this project will be less beautiful than I originally envisioned. But I will just try to work with what I can and still make something cool!
